1) `Common Design Elements`

Below are some common terms that you’ll encounter when discussing the design of webpages and apps. Review these terms before watching the next video.
copy

Refers to written material included in your product (in contrast to photographs or other elements of layout).
headline

Words that communicate what the company or product does; different headlines will work for different products and user goals; choose wisely.

**tagline**

Taglines contain phrases that explain the key benefits and purpose of your product. Taglines are critical because people scan websites, especially first time visitors who are just beginning to understand your product.

__value proposition__

A promise of value to be delivered and acknowledged and a belief from the customer that value will be delivered and experienced. A value proposition can apply to an entire organization, or parts thereof, or customer accounts, or products or services.
below the fold

The content area of a screen that is not visible without scrolling; many website home pages contain additional content “below the fold”.
call to action (CTA)

An instruction to the audience to provoke an immediate response, usually using an imperative verb such as “call now”, “sign up”, “buy now”, or “visit a store today”; these often take the form of buttons.

4) Forms

Signup and payment forms require you to get and verify information from the user. There’s lots of advice for creating forms, and we’ve curated some of the best resources and examples from existing products and the web

First, keep it simple. Users are more likely to complete forms, signup, and pay, when those forms are easy and intuitive. Clear descriptions, vertical layouts, pre-populated forms, examples, and clear calls to action can help users make sense of the form and make them more willing to spend the time to fill them out. This also means that you should only ask for as much information as you need.

Second, validate user input and provide feedback Next, you can increase the chance that users succeed by designing forms by checking what user’s type and by providing corrective feedback, examples, and even suggestions. Is the user’s phone number in the correct format? Did the user choose a username that is already taken? Does the form verify input after the user finishes typing in each box? These are essential features of your form that can drive up the number of successful users.

Example of inline validated form

Finally, always test your forms. You can test the form yourself. Some teams have done this by a role play between a user and a browser. The browser can only respond with the copy on the page. Is the form easy to complete? Are formatting options clear? Did the user get stuck, frustrated, or lost?

For more information on designing forms, check out these awesome resources:
Why Details Matter in Payments: Conversions!

The $300 Million Button On BestBuy.com, the small change of allowing people to skip sign-up during checkout resulted in $300 million extra revenue per year.

Double Conversion Rates with Optional Fields ClickTale doubled their sign-up conversions from 40% to 80% with a simple change of adding an explicit and very visible “optional” label to the phone number input box.

User Experience Design Resources

These resources can help you analyze previous products and learn from others about what does work and what doesn’t.

UX Archive
explore how others approach designing for specific tasks

The authors of the site recommend you to try out the website first (before comparing any user flows). Once you have been through the application, you can use the archive to compare different design approaches for the same task. This will help you visualize all the flows and steps so you can compare the approaches more easily. Let this inspire design pattern and user flow discussions with you and your team.

Google Ventures has an excellent library of resources related to conducting user research. Look for articles that you think are most helpful to you.
